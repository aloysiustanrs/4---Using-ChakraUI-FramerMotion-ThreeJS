In this blog, I will share how I created my my own discord bot using <TextWithLink text="discord.py" link="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py" /> which is a API wrapper for Discord so that I can create the discord API more easily with Python.

If there is any information that is unclear in this blog, you can refer to my Github repository of this project: <TextWithLink text="Github Link" link="https://github.com/aloysiustanrs/all-crypto" /> or my youtube video above.

<Header>Why am I creating a discord bot?</Header>

&nbsp; 1. Practice my python skills

&nbsp; 2. Create a bot which has customised features 

&nbsp; 3. I can name the bot whatever I want :)

<Header>How to create discord bot?</Header>

Go to <TextWithLink text="Discord Developer Portal" link="https://discord.com/developers/applications" /> and create a new application.
<br />
Go to 'Bot' tab and create a new bot, enabling all 'Privileged Gateway Intents'
<br />
Go to 'OAuth2' tab > General: Select the 'In-app Authorization' > Scopes: Select 'bot' & 'applications.commands' > Bot Permissions: Administrator
<br />
Go to 'OAuth2' tab > URL Generator > Scopes: Select 'bot' > Copy link and paste onto browser > Add the bot to your discord channel

<Header>Coding the bot</Header>

In order to code the bot, I will be using the <TextWithLink text="discord.py" link="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py" /> so that it is easier to code out the discord bot in Python.

Features of the bot
</SubHeader>
&nbsp; 1. Anime recommendation 

&nbsp; 2. Clear Messages

&nbsp; 3. Play music

<br />
I will explain how I implement these features with the bot below.

<Header>Anime recommendation</Header>
<SubHeader>
Why this feature?
</SubHeader>
I have a discord channel with my friends and we like to watch anime. However, as a long time anime fan, I have already watched alot of anime.
<br />
Therefore, I thought of adding a feature to the discord bot where with one command, I can have a random anime recommended to me with all its details and I might consider watching it.
